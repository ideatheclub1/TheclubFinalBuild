# ❤️ Likes Feature Guide

## 🎯 **New Feature: See Who Liked Posts**

I've added a new feature to show who liked each post in your feed! Now when you tap on the likes count, you'll see a beautiful modal with all the users who liked that post.

---

## ✨ **What's New:**

### **Tap to See Likes**
- **Tap the likes count** on any post (e.g., "1,234 likes")
- **Beautiful modal slides up** from the bottom
- **See all users** who liked the post
- **Tap on any user** to visit their profile

### **Features Included:**
- ✅ **Real-time likes loading** with loading indicator
- ✅ **User avatars and usernames** displayed
- ✅ **User bios** shown (if available)
- ✅ **Tap to visit profiles** - closes modal and opens user profile
- ✅ **Empty state** - shows "No likes yet" with icon
- ✅ **Smooth animations** and haptic feedback
- ✅ **Dark theme** matching your app design

---

## 🎨 **How It Works:**

### **1. Tap Likes Count**
```
Post → "1,234 likes" → Tap → Modal Opens ✅
```

### **2. View Users Who Liked**
```
Modal shows:
- User avatar (48x48px)
- Username (@username)
- Bio (if available)
- Tap to visit profile
```

### **3. Visit User Profiles**
```
Tap user → Modal closes → Profile opens ✅
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Backend Service Added:**
```typescript
// New method in dataService.post
async getPostLikes(postId: string, currentUserId?: string): Promise<User[]>
```

### **Frontend Components:**
- ✅ **Likes Modal** - Full-screen modal with user list
- ✅ **Loading States** - Activity indicator while fetching
- ✅ **Empty States** - Beautiful "no likes" message
- ✅ **User List** - Scrollable list with user cards
- ✅ **Profile Navigation** - Tap to visit user profiles

### **Database Query:**
```sql
-- Fetches users who liked a specific post
SELECT user_profiles.* FROM likes 
JOIN user_profiles ON likes.user_id = user_profiles.id 
WHERE likes.post_id = ? 
ORDER BY likes.created_at DESC
```

## 📱 **User Experience:**

### **Visual Design:**
- **Dark theme** matching your app (#1E1E1E background)
- **Rounded corners** (24px border radius)
- **Smooth slide animation** from bottom
- **Glass effect** with shadows and blur
- **Consistent typography** with your app fonts

### **Interactions:**
- **Tap likes count** → Opens modal
- **Tap X button** → Closes modal
