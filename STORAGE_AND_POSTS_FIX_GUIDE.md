# ðŸš€ Storage and Posts Fix Guide

## ðŸ”§ **Issue 1: Storage Bucket Error**

**Error:** `"Bucket not found"` when uploading media

### **Solution: Run Storage Setup SQL**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Run this SQL script:**

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of database_storage_setup_simple.sql
-- This will create the required storage buckets:
-- - user-media (for photos/videos section)
-- - posts (for post images)
-- - reels (for video content)
```

### **What this fixes:**
- âœ… Creates `user-media` bucket for PhotosVideosScreen
- âœ… Creates `posts` bucket for post images
- âœ… Creates `reels` bucket for video content
- âœ… Sets up proper RLS policies for security
- âœ… Enables public access to media files

## ðŸ”§ **Issue 2: Posts Not Showing in Feed**

**Problem:** Posts created from camera don't appear in feed or profile

### **What I Fixed:**

1. **âœ… Fixed Post Creation Method**
   - Changed from object parameter to individual parameters
   - Now properly calls `dataService.post.createPost(userId, content, imageUrl)`

2. **âœ… Added Video Support**
   - Images â†’ Create Posts
   - Videos â†’ Create Reels
   - Both will show in appropriate feeds

3. **âœ… Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Better error messages
   - Proper success/failure detection

## ðŸŽ¯ **How Posts Work Now:**

```
Camera â†’ Take Photo â†’ Upload to 'posts' bucket â†’ Create Post â†’ Show in Feed âœ…
```

### **Video Posts:**
```
Camera â†’ Record Video â†’ Upload to 'reels' bucket â†’ Create Reel â†’ Show in Reels âœ…
```

### **Gallery Uploads:**
```
Gallery â†’ Select Media â†’ Upload to appropriate bucket â†’ Create Post/Reel â†’ Show in Feed âœ…
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Testing Checklist:**

### **After running the SQL:**

1. **âœ… Take a photo** â†’ Should upload and create post
2. **âœ… Record a video** â†’ Should upload and create reel  
3. **âœ… Import from gallery** â†’ Should work for both images/videos
4. **âœ… Check feed** â†’ Posts should appear in main feed
5. **âœ… Check profile** â†’ Posts should appear on your profile
6. **âœ… Check reels** â†’ Videos should appear in reels section

## ðŸš¨ **If You Still Get Errors:**

### **Storage Error:**
- Make sure you ran the SQL in Supabase Dashboard
