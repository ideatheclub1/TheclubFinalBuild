# 🔍 Likes & Comments System Verification

## 🎯 **What We're Checking:**

1. **✅ Backend Database Setup** - Likes table and relationships
2. **✅ Frontend Integration** - Likes modal and functionality  
3. **✅ Comments System** - Username display and linking
4. **✅ Sample Data** - Test data for verification

---

## 🗄️ **Backend Database Verification**

### **Step 1: Run the SQL Setup**
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of database_likes_system_setup.sql
-- This will create all necessary tables, relationships, and sample data
```

### **Step 2: Verify Database Structure**
Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if likes table exists
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'likes';

-- Check likes table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'likes' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check foreign key relationships
SELECT 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
    AND tc.table_name='likes';

-- Check sample data
SELECT 
    l.id as like_id,
    l.user_id,
    l.post_id,
    up.username,
    p.content as post_content,
    l.created_at
FROM likes l
JOIN user_profiles up ON l.user_id = up.id
JOIN posts p ON l.post_id = p.id
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC;
```

---

## 📱 **Frontend Integration Verification**

### **Step 3: Test Likes Feature**
1. **Open your app** and go to feed
2. **Find a post** with likes (or create one)
3. **Tap the likes count** (e.g., "2 likes")
4. **Verify modal opens** with user list
5. **Check console logs** for debugging info

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
Fetching likes for post: [post-id]
Raw likes data: [{user_id: "...", user_profiles: [{id: "...", username: "...", ...}]}]
Processing like: {user_id: "...", user_profiles: [...]}
Created user: {id: "...", username: "...", avatar: "...", ...}
Final users array: [{id: "...", username: "...", ...}]
```

### **Step 4: Test Comments System**
1. **Tap comment icon** on any post
2. **Check if usernames display** properly (not placeholders)
3. **Verify comment structure** shows real usernames
4. **Test comment interactions** (like, reply, edit)

---

## 🔧 **Comments System Analysis**

### **Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// In CommentSystem.tsx line 122
<Text style={styles.commentUsername}>{comment.user.username}</Text>
```

### **Expected Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string;
  user: {
    id: string;
    username: string;  // ✅ This should be real username
    avatar: string;
  };
  content: string;
  timestamp: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **If Usernames Show as Placeholders:**
The issue might be in the comment fetching service. Check:

1. **Comment Context** - `contexts/CommentContext.tsx`
2. **Data Service** - `services/dataService.ts` comment methods
3. **Database Query** - Ensure user data is properly joined

---

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"**
**Cause:** User profile data not properly joined in likes query
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed in the updated `getPostLikes` method

### **Issue 2: Comments show placeholder usernames**
**Cause:** Comment query doesn't include user data
**Solution:** Check comment fetching service

### **Issue 3: Likes modal doesn't open**
**Cause:** Tap handler not working
**Solution:** Verify `handleShowLikes` function is called

### **Issue 4: No likes showing in database**
**Cause:** No sample data or foreign key issues
**Solution:** Run the SQL setup script

---

## 📊 **Verification Checklist**

### **Backend Database:**
- ✅ **Likes table exists** with proper structure
- ✅ **Foreign key relationships** are established
- ✅ **Sample data** is inserted
- ✅ **RLS policies** are configured
- ✅ **Indexes** are created for performance

### **Frontend Integration:**
- ✅ **Likes modal opens** when tapping likes count
- ✅ **User list displays** with avatars and names
- ✅ **Profile navigation** works when tapping users
- ✅ **Loading states** show properly
- ✅ **Empty states** display correctly

### **Comments System:**
- ✅ **Usernames display** as real usernames (not placeholders)
- ✅ **Comment interactions** work (like, reply, edit)
- ✅ **User navigation** works from comments
- ✅ **Comment counts** update properly

---

## 🔍 **Debugging Commands**

### **Check Database Directly:**
```sql
-- Verify likes exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes;

-- Check user profiles
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles;

-- Test the join manually
SELECT l.*, up.username, p.content
FROM likes l
JOIN user_profiles up ON l.user_id = up.id
JOIN posts p ON l.post_id = p.id
LIMIT 5;
```

### **Check Frontend Logs:**
Look for these console messages:
- ✅ `Fetching likes for post: [id]`
- ✅ `Raw likes data: [data]`
- ✅ `Processing like: [like]`
- ✅ `Created user: [user]`
- ✅ `Final users array: [users]`

---

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

### **When Everything Works:**
- ✅ **Likes modal opens** smoothly
- ✅ **User list shows** real usernames and avatars
- ✅ **Comments display** real usernames
- ✅ **Profile navigation** works from both likes and comments
- ✅ **No console errors**
- ✅ **Sample data** appears in feed

### **Expected User Experience:**
```
Tap "2 likes" → Modal opens → See user list → Tap user → Profile opens ✅
Tap comment → See real usernames → Tap username → Profile opens ✅
```

## 🚀 **Quick Fix Steps:**

1. **✅ Run the SQL setup** (`database_likes_system_setup.sql`)
2. **✅ Restart your app** to clear cached errors
3. **✅ Test with sample data** that was created
4. **✅ Check console logs** for debugging info
5. **✅ Verify database relationships** are correct
6. **✅ Test both likes and comments** functionality

The system should now be fully integrated and working! 🎉✨
