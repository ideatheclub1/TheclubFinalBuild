## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Structure

#### Reviews Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    reviewer_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    reviewed_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### User Profiles Enhancement
```sql
-- Added to user_profiles table
ALTER TABLE user_profiles 
ADD COLUMN community_trust_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### Trust Score Calculation

The Community Trust Score is calculated using this formula:

```
Trust Score = Base Score + Review Bonus + Completion Bonus + Verification Bonus + Host Bonus

Where:
- Base Score: Rating √ó 10 (0-50 points)
- Review Bonus: Based on number of reviews (0-20 points)
  - 50+ reviews: 20 points
  - 20+ reviews: 15 points
  - 10+ reviews: 10 points
  - 5+ reviews: 5 points
- Completion Bonus: Profile completion % √ó 0.15 (0-15 points)
- Verification Bonus: 10 points if verified
- Host Bonus: 5 points if host
```

### RLS Policies

```sql
-- Users can view all reviews
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all reviews" ON reviews
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Users can create reviews (but not for themselves)
CREATE POLICY "Users can create reviews" ON reviews
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() = reviewer_id AND 
        reviewer_id != reviewed_id
    );

-- Users can delete their own reviews
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own reviews" ON reviews
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = reviewer_id);

-- No UPDATE policy = no editing allowed
```

SELECT 
  id,
  rating,
  total_reviews,
  profile_completion_percentage,
  is_verified,
  is_host,
  community_trust_score
