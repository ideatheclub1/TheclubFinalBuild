# 🧪 Delete Functionality Test Guide

## Current Issue
The delete functionality is not working, and we need to debug why. There are syntax errors in ProfileScreen.tsx that need to be fixed first.

## 🔧 Debug Steps to Follow

### 1. **Check Debug Button**
- Go to your ProfileScreen
- Look for a small red **🔧** button in the stats section (next to Posts and Reels counts)
- Tap this button to run the debug test
- Check console for output

### 2. **Check Console Output**
Look for these logs in your console:
```
🚀 DEBUG LOGGER INITIALIZED - If you see this, console.log is working!
📍 Debug logger enabled: true
📊 Current time: [timestamp]
```

### 3. **Test Delete Button Visibility**
- Make sure you're viewing your own profile (not someone else's)
- Check if the trash can icons appear on your posts and reels
- The delete buttons should only show for your own content

### 4. **Test Delete Button Press**
When you tap a delete button, look for these console logs:
```
🔥 DELETE BUTTON PRESSED IN RENDERPOST: { itemId: "...", username: "..." }
🗑️ DELETE POST CALLED: { postId: "...", postUsername: "..." }
✅ AUTHORIZATION PASSED, SHOWING CONFIRMATION...
```

### 5. **Test Confirmation Dialog**
- A confirmation dialog should appear
- If you tap "Delete", look for:
```
✅ DELETE POST CONFIRMED, STARTING DELETE...
📞 CALLING dataService.post.deletePost... { postId: "...", userId: "..." }
📞 DELETE POST RESULT: true/false
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: **No Debug Button Visible**
- You might not be on your own profile
- Check `isCurrentUser` value in debug test

### Issue 2: **No Delete Buttons Visible**
- Ensure you're on your own profile
- Check if `isCurrentUser` is true

### Issue 3: **No Console Logs**
- Check Metro bundler terminal (where you ran `npm start`)
- If testing in web browser, check browser console (F12 → Console)

### Issue 4: **Delete Buttons Don't Respond**
- Check for console errors
- Verify touch targets are working

### Issue 5: **Confirmation Dialog Doesn't Appear**
- Check console for authorization errors
- Verify current user is set correctly

### Issue 6: **Delete Fails**
- Check network connection
- Verify database connection
- Check Supabase logs for RLS policy issues

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **First**: Fix syntax errors in ProfileScreen.tsx
2. **Then**: Test debug button functionality
3. **Finally**: Test actual delete operations

## 🔍 Console Commands

You can also test directly in console:
```javascript
// Test debug logger
debug.test();

// Test data service availability
console.log('DataService:', !!dataService);
console.log('Delete methods:', {
  deletePost: typeof dataService?.post?.deletePost,
  deleteReel: typeof dataService?.reel?.deleteReel
});
```

## 📱 Where to Look for Logs

**React Native/Expo:**
- Metro bundler terminal
- `expo logs` command
- React Native debugger

**Web:**
- Browser console (F12)
- Network tab for API calls

**Device:**
- `npx react-native log-android`
- `npx react-native log-ios`
