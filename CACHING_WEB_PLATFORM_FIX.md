# Web Platform Caching Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed `ERR_UNAVAILABLE` media caching errors on web platform when trying to cache videos and images.

## Root Cause
- Expo's FileSystem API doesn't work the same way on web platform as on mobile
- Attempting to use `FileSystem.downloadAsync()` and file operations on web caused failures
- The caching system was trying to download and store files locally on web, which isn't supported

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Platform Detection
Added `Platform` import and detection throughout the caching service:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
```

### 2. Web Platform Bypass
Modified key methods to bypass file operations on web:

#### `cacheMedia()` Method
- Returns original URL immediately on web platform
- Logs web platform passthrough for debugging
- Only performs file caching on mobile platforms

#### `getCachedMediaPath()` Method
- Returns original URL immediately on web platform
- Skips file existence checks

#### `initializeMediaCache()` Method
- Skips directory creation and media cache initialization on web
- Only sets up file system cache on mobile

#### `useCachedMedia()` Hook
- Immediately returns original URL on web without loading state
- Prevents unnecessary async operations

### 3. Persistence Handling
- Skips media cache persistence to AsyncStorage on web
- Prevents errors from trying to persist non-existent file paths

## Benefits

### ✅ **Error Elimination**
- No more `ERR_UNAVAILABLE` errors on web platform
- Graceful degradation to direct URL usage

### ✅ **Performance**
- Immediate media loading on web (no caching overhead)
- Maintains full caching benefits on mobile platforms

### ✅ **Consistency**
- Same API across platforms
- Components work identically without platform-specific code

### ✅ **Debugging**
- Clear logging for web platform behavior
- Easy to identify when web passthrough is being used

## Platform Behavior

### Web Platform
- **Images**: Uses original URLs directly
- **Videos**: Uses original URLs directly  
- **Caching**: Memory cache only (no file system)
- **Performance**: Immediate loading, relies on browser cache

### Mobile Platforms (iOS/Android)
- **Images**: Downloads and caches locally
- **Videos**: Downloads and caches locally
- **Caching**: Full file system + memory cache
- **Performance**: Faster subsequent loads, offline support

## Code Changes Summary

1. **Added Platform import** to cacheService.ts
2. **Modified cacheMedia()** - web platform returns original URL
3. **Modified getCachedMediaPath()** - web platform returns original URL
4. **Modified initializeMediaCache()** - skips on web
5. **Modified persistMediaCache()** - skips on web
6. **Modified useCachedMedia()** - immediate return on web

## Testing Verification

After these changes, you should see:
- ✅ No more `ERR_UNAVAILABLE` media cache errors
- ✅ Images and videos load properly on web
- ✅ `MEDIA_WEB_PASSTHROUGH` logs in console for web platform
- ✅ Full caching functionality preserved on mobile

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing browser-based caching for web platform:
- IndexedDB storage for larger media files
- Service Worker caching strategies
- Progressive Web App cache manifests
